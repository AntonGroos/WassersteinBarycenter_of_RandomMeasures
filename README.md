# WassersteinBarycenter_of_RandomMeasures
This repository contains the code I wrote to calculate portfolios on the stockmarket using Wasserstein barycenters of random measures.  

All credit of the Wasserstein barycenter algorithm used to calculate these goes to Johannes von Lindheim, who was kind enough to let me use and upload them.
